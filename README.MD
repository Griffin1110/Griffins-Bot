My old discord bot made in discord.js - No longer being worked on, instead I'm working on a rewrite

to install install it and unzip it if you downloaded the zip then change he file "example.config.json" to "config.json" and open it, then fill out the fields in between the quotation marks with your ID and the bot token etc. Then in the bot directory open a command prompt or powershell window to the directory either by using the cd command (cd C:/this/is/a/path) or by right clicking in the directory and pressing open command/powershell window here. Then make sure you have nodejs installed (If you don't google nodejs and download the one reccomended on the website) and in the command/powershell window type "npm install" then once you've done all that; double click on run.bat

ok bye now
